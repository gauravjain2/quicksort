### Quick Sort Implementation in C++
Implemented Using vectors in C++ in Codeblocks IDE (MinGW GCC Compiler)

#### Functions:

```
=> swapp(vector<int>,int,int) 
    ->Swap 2 values of the array(index of elements as parameters)

=> partition
    -> returns the index of correct position of pivot element passed
    
=> quicksort
    ->Recursive function to do the sorting on partitioned vectors
  
=> main
